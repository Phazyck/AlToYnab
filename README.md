# AlToYnab
An AL CSV to YNAB CSV converter.

A simple file converter I wrote, to convert my bank statements to a format that can be read by the YNAB budgeting application.

AL is short for Arbejdernes Landsbank, the Danish bank I've been using since I ever had an account.
Currently, I can export my statements as a CSV file, but sadly, even though my budgeting application, YNAB, can read CSV files, the formats don't match up. To solve this, I made AlToYnab, which can take a CSV bank statement from AL, and convert it to a CSV file that is readable by YNAB.
